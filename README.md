Calculator Project on Python is done using Loops, which helps to enhance the basic practice on loops. 
I have done this project to enhance my knowledge on Loops in Python.
This project is done using while loop, for loop, if, else, elif.
It performes basic mathematical funnctions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square and cube.
It is more secure which means you may not enter other anything except the numerical values.
It is more relevant and easy to use for an user.
In the first part of project, there are basic mathematical functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are there.
and in the next part, another functions such as square and cube are added.
